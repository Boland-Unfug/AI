I had to do a different thing in order to get the autograder to work, now that python 3.6 is depriciated.
You can run the code and autograder if you activate the py3.6 conda environment, using conda activate py3.6
Please contact me if the code does not run, I passed all tests on my own computer and it is likely unintentional
